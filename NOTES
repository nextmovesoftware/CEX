Notes for cex101

[ ] changed references in cobweb/*.c:
      cx_fgetc()    to     cx_e_fgetc()
      cx_fgets()    to     cx_e_fgets()
      cx_eof()      to     cx_e_eof()

[ ] deal with cx_e_feof() in cx_stream.c (changed to cx_e_eof())

[ ] changed cx_fputs() and cx_fputc() to cx_e_fputs() and cx_e_fputc()
    in camera/cu_camera.c  NOT RIGHT change later

[ ] whew! changed cx_fputs() and cx_fputc() to cx_e_fputs() and cx_e_fputc()
      cx_e_fgetc()    to     cx_e_iogetc()
      cx_e_fgets()    to     cx_e_iogets()
      cx_e_eof()      to     cx_e_ioeof()
      cx_e_flush()    to     cx_e_ioflush()
      cx_e_close()    to     cx_e_ioclose()
    They all take objects!

[ ] removed all references to cx_IOStream, made them cx_Object

[ ] removed all references to cx_fopen() made them cx_create_iostream()

[ ] removed some references to fclose() made them cx_destroy()

[ ] moved low-level test functions into cobweb/TODO, deal with that later

[ ] cu/camera -- changed cameraone to use iostream

[o] applics/cex -- updated catcex, removed minor bug (closed input 2ce)
      [o] catcex   [o] printcex
