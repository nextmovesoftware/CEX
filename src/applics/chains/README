Unfortunately, I didn't quite manage to finish the port of the
"mdl2pdb" code to CEX before the release of version 32. However,
here is the functional, but incomplete, version of "chains".
Those feeling enthusiastic may want to implement the remaining
two or three routines from the outline code given in the file
"mdl2pdb.algorithm"
