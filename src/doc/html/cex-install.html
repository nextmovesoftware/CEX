CEX RELEASE 0.33 -- $CX_ROOT/README

This top-level README is a short note outlining the distribution contents,
avaliable documentation, and installation procedures.

This is a developmental release of the CEX software for chemical information
exchange.  It's starting to look pretty good, but nothing is finalized yet.
Please send comments, critiques, and kudos to dave@daylight.com.

There are two ways you might have gotten this release: either as a clean
source directory, e.g., cex033clean.tar.gz, or as a prebuilt binary for a
single architecture e.g., cex033sun54bin.tar.gz.  In either case, gunzipping
and untaring the file will produce a single directory, cex033.  This is how
it's typically installed:

   First time only, make a directory to hold cex releases:
   
      $ su
      Password:
      # mkdir /usr/local/cex
      # chown username /usr/local/cex
      # exit
      $

   Install the release:
   
      $ cd /usr/local/cex
      $ gzip -cdq cex033clean.tar.gz | tar xf -
      ...
      $ ls
      cex033

   Define CX_ROOT (typically done in .profile) and update your paths:
   
      $ CX_ROOT=/usr/local/cex/cex033
      $ export CX_ROOT
      $ PATH=$PATH:$CX_ROOT/bin
      $ export PATH
      $ MANPATH=$MANPATH:$CX_ROOT/doc/man
      $ export MANPATH

If you have a binary release, you're ready to go, everything is preinstalled
in $CX_ROOT subdirectories: bin (programs), data (datatypes), doc (documents),
include (headers) and lib (libraries),

If you have a clean source release, you'll need to make the system:

      $ cd $CX_ROOT
      $ make
      installing /usr/local/cex/cex033/src/cobweb
      ... make reports a lot of stuff here ...
      +---------------------------------------------------
      | All CX source is compiled, linked, and installed.
      +---------------------------------------------------

If you have installed clean source but *only* want the binary release,
you can save space by deleting all source files with:

      $ rm -rf $CX_ROOT/src

The prebuilt releases have PostScript versions of the reference manuals in
$CX_ROOT/doc/postman, e.g., man3cx.ps.  These are pretty big and can be
deleted if you want to save space.  The PostScript files can be created
from a clean source release on Solaris only:

     $ cd $CX_ROOT/src/doc/man
     $ make postman

That's about it.  Check out the documents in $CX_ROOT/doc for more info.

Have fun.
