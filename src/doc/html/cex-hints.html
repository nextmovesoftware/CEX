These are some hints about programming with and developing the CEX interface.
If you are not familiar with an oopish interface such as the Daylight Toolkit,
you will probably need to carefully examine the provided code to see how it's
done.  It's simple, but different from either procedural (e.g., C, Fortran)
or object-oriented (C++, Smalltalk) programming.

<A NAME=PART1>
<H3>Fortran programmers, do not fail to declare all functions</H3>
</A>
In Fortran, "GOD is REAL unless declared otherwise."
<P>
The most common (and frustrating) errors encountered when using the
CEX interface from Fortran are due to failure to declare functions.
Names of the Fortran CEX function wrappers start "cx_f_" and are
implicitly REAL but most of the return values aren't REAL, leading
to unexpected results if not declared explicitly.  In practice, this
seems to be a problem even for experienced programmers.
<P>
The Fortran wrappers (e.g., cx_f.inc) in the current version declare
all CEX functions explicitly.  This is help, but has the disadvantage
the function declarations take program space in Fortran programs.
Also, you typically get a pile of warnings about unused functions.
<P>
Earlier versions did not declare functions, relying on the programmer
to declare the ones that were used in each program segment.  This avoids
the above disadvantages but leads to buggy code.  If you are using a
a Fortran compiler which accepts "IMPLICIT NONE" command, you might
choose to comment out all the function declarations in the cx_f_*.inc
wrappers.
<P>
This isn't often a problem in ANSI-C since strong type-checking is
default for most compilers.  But it can be a problem when using earlier
(K&R) C compilers, or if type-checking is turned off.  (God is int in
K&R-C unless declared otherwise.)
<P>
In any event, when something unexpected happens, check that every
function is explicitly declared correctly!

READ THE CEX DEVELOPER'S MANUAL (cex-devman) FIRST!
<UL>
<LI>Create a directory in $CX_ROOT/src/cu, e.g., setpart or camera.
</LI><P>
<LI>Put the new source code into this directory.
</LI><P>
<LI>Create an ANSI-C header (.h) file which includes prototypes of the
new public entry points with names starting "cu_", e.g., cu_camera.h.
</LI><P>
<LI>Write the Makefile such that "make install" adds .o files containing
the new public entry points to $CX_ROOT/lib/libcu.a.  All other entry
points in these .o files should be static (i.e., not public).  Also,
"make install" should copy the .h file to $CX_ROOT/include.
</LI><P>
<LI>Edit $CX_ROOT/src/cu/cu.h to include the new .h file.  Programmers can
then just #include "cu.h" to gain access to all cu-level functions.
</LI><P>
<LI>Create a Fortran-77 include file, e.g., "cu_f_camera.inc" and code
which implements these entry points, e.g., "cu_f_camera_wrap.c".
This is generally done in ANSI-C with .c and .h source code in
$CX_ROOT/src/wrappers/f77.  Make sure that "make install" installs
the .h file in $CX_ROOT/include and the wrapper entry points in
$CX_ROOT/lib/libcx_f.a.

For example, the camera object prototype used these properties:
<PRE>
     property name     language  example
   ------------------  --------  ---------------------
   "camera position"    STRING   "4.73,80.0,-0.1"
   "scene center"       STRING   "0.0,0.0,0.0"
   "focal length"       REAL     "80.0"
   "clip hither"        REAL     "10.0"
   "clip yon"           REAL     "100.0"
   "view area"          STRING   "-5.0,5.0,-3.0,3.0"
   "render size"        STRING   "640,480"
   "background color"   STRING   "black"
</PRE>
Note that most of the above properties have values which are more complex
than simple scalar values.  This means that each calling program must
treat each property as a string, know the "shape" of each property and 
implement parsers/generators.  Each of these steps introduces the
possibility of error.  For instance, a C application would get the render
size this way:
<PRE>
   cx_Object  camera;
   cx_String *renderstr;
   cx_Real    renderwidth, renderheight;
   ...
   if (NULL == (renderstr = cx_sprop(camera, "render size")) ||
       2 != sscanf(renderstr, "%f,%f", &renderwidth, &renderheight)) {
      renderwidth  = DEFAULT_WIDTH;
      renderheight = DEFAULT_HEIGHT;
   }
   ...
</PRE>
Note that this is a pretty smart program: it knows how to interpret the
stringvalue of the "render size" property, e.g., that there are two parts,
what delimiter is used, whether width or height comes first, and that
they are each encoded in fixed format (%f).
<P>
All of the above camera properties can be reformulated as simple, scalar
properties, e.g.,
<PRE>
     property name     language  example
   ------------------  --------  ---------------------
   "camera x"           REAL     "4.73"
   "camera y"           REAL     "80.0"
   "camera z"           REAL     "-0.1"
   "scene center x"     REAL     "0.0"
   "scene center y"     REAL     "0.0"
   "scene center z"     REAL     "0.0"
   "focal length"       REAL     "80.0"
   "clip hither"        REAL     "10.0"
   "clip yon"           REAL     "100.0"
   "view xmin"          REAL     "-5.0"
   "view xmax"          REAL     "5.0"
   "view ymin"          REAL     "-3.0"
   "view ymax"          REAL     "3.0"
   "render width"       REAL     "640.0"
   "render height"      REAL     "480.0"
   "background color"   INTEGER  "0"
</PRE>
Although this doubles the number of camera properties (8 to 16), such
irreducable representations lead to simpler and more robust applications.
For instance, an application would get render geometry in this way:
<PRE>
   cx_Object  camera;
   cx_Real    renderwidth  = DEFAULT_WIDTH;
   cx_Real    renderheight = DEFAULT_HEIGHT;
   ...
   if (NULL != cx_sprop(camera, "render width" ) &&
       NULL != cx_sprop(camera, "render height"))
         renderwidth  = cx_rprop(camera, "render width");
	 renderheight = cx_rprop(camera, "render height");
      }
      ...
</PRE>
Note that this is a pretty dumb and robust program.  It doesn't need to
know anything except that the two properties of interest are REAL (part
of the datatype definition.)  Since there are many (4) fewer assumptions,
there is that much less which can go wrong.
