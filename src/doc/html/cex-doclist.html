<LI><B>CEX Documentation List</B><P>
This is the document you are currently reading.  It mainly
provides a place to keep track of all the documentation for
a given release.
</LI><P>

<LI><A HREF=cex-install.html><B>Installation README</B></A><P>
The top-level README is a short note to the initial installer
outlining the distribution contents, avaliable documentation,
and installation procedures.
</LI><P>

<LI><B>CEX User's Guide</B><P>
The user guide is intended to contain an introduction to the CEX
utilities oriented to the end-user, provide an overview of the
CEX applications supplied in this release and to illustrate the
intended usage of these applications.  In this release, the user
guide is just a stub, which will be filled out after the initial
set of applications settles down.
Or, the CEX User's Guide may be eliminated if the man1cx pages do
the job adequately.
</LI><P>

<LI><A HREF=cex-progman.html><B>CEX Programmer's Guide</B></A><P>
The programmer's guide is intended to provide information and
guidance needed to port an existing application to use CEX I/O
or to write a native CEX filter.  The current incarnation is
kind of heavy on philosophy and a bit light on complex examples.
By design, it contains no reference information.
</LI><P>

<LI><A HREF=cex-devman.html><B>CEX Developer's Guide</B></A><P>
The developer's guide contains information about the CX development
system itself and instructions for programmers who are interested
in doing low-level things like inventing their own object classes.
Some of the information contained here probably belongs in the
programmer's guide.
</LI><P>

<LI><B>man(1cx) pages</B><P>
Section 1cx manual pages provide reference for CEX application
programs.  The manual pages provided for CEX applications in this
release are complete, but the set of applications itself is far
from complete.
</LI><P>

<LI><B>man(3cx) pages</B><P>
Section 3cx manual pages provide reference for CX library functions
in libcx.a and an example function in libcu.a.  These man pages
form the bulk of the documentation needed to create CEX-compatible
programs.  Only high-level CX-interface functions used at the
application-level are described in detail (one per page).
Low-level functions are all described on the lowelevel(3cx) page.
</LI><P>

<LI><B>man(5cx) pages</B><P>
Section 5cx manual pages provide reference for CX primitive and
object types.
</LI><P>

<LI><A HREF=cex-status.html><B>STATUS</B></A><P>
A synopsis of the status of the current release.

<LI><A HREF=cex-projects.html><B>Projects</B></A><P>

</LI><P>

<LI><A HREF=cex-changelog.html><B>Change Log</B></A><P>
