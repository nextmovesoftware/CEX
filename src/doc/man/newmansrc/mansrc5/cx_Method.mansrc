cx_Method \- CX primitive function
<description>
A cx_Method primitive represents a (possibly polymorphic) function.

In the ANSI-C interface, a cx_Method is a void (*)(), e.g.,
a generic function pointer.

In the Fortran interface, a cx_Method is a FUNCTION name.
However, CX methods are only used internally and since all the CX
internals are written in ANSI C,
there is no need for a CX-level Fortran application or function
to deal with methods.
