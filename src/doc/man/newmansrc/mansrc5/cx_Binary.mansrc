cx_Binary \- CX primitive binary representation
<description>
A cx_Binary primitive is a string of arbitrary characters with
an explicit length.

In the ANSI-C interface, a cx_Binary is represented as a
an (unsigned char *) pointer and a cx_Integer (32-bit) length.

In the Fortran interface, a cx_Binary is represented as a
CHARACTER*() variable and a an INTEGER*4 length.
