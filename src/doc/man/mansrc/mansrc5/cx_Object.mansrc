cx_Object \- CX primitive object handle
<description>
A cx_Object primitive represents an opaque reference to an object.
A cx_Object representation always has at least 32 significant bits.
In the CX system, all complex (i.e., non-primitive) types of information 
are objects which are referred to exclusively by cx_Object handles.

In the ANSI-C interface, cx_Object is typedef'd to (void *).

In the Fortran interface, a cx_Object is an INTEGER*4.
