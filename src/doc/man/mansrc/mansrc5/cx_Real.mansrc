cx_Real \- CX primitive real number
<description>
A cx_Real primitive is a 64-bit real number,
ultimately represented in IEEE format.
IEEE conversion is automatically provided by the interface wrappers
to and from native formats in non-IEEE environments.

In the ANSI-C interface, a cx_Real is usually typedef'd in cx_types.h
as a (double), but depends on the environment.

In the Fortran interface, a cx_Real is a REAL*8 variable.
