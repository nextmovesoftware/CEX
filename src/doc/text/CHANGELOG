------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CEX032->CEX033

   o  objects are now read recursively by package (Dave Weininger)

   o  standardized camera and surface objects (Dave Weininger)

   o  standardized pdb and bondage Makefile's (Dave Weininger)

   o  changed cu.h to include cu_camera.h

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CEX031->CEX032

   This version basically represents the results from the Beaverton meeting.
   Purpose was to integrate work done so far, develop stable Makefiles on as
   many target platforms as possible, and remove applications not-ready-for-
   prime-time: dgeom/compare (awaiting license release from QCPE) and rasmol
   (only make-s on two O/S's so far).  We ran out of time and didn't meet
   these goals, so the 0.32 version isn't released.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CEX030->CEX031

   o  Revised pdb support (now based on Midas PDB parser).
      Contributed by Conrad Huang (UCSF).

   o  Added camera object as root data object.
      Contributed by Conrad Huang (UCSF).

   o  Added surface object as root object.
      Contributed by Anthony Nichols (Columbia) and Conrad Huang (UCSF).

   o  Added bondage, a new application which deduces bond order from 3-D
      geometry (atom "coordinates") property.  Contributed by Eric Swanson
      (U. of Washington), Jeff Blaney (Chiron), and Scott Dixon (SKB),
      ported to cex by David Spellmeyer (Chiron).

   o  Added chains, a new application which deduces peptide chain and residue
      identification from connectivity.  Contributed by Roger Sayle (Glaxo).

   o  Added connect, a new application which deduces connectivity from
      interatomic distances.  Contributed by Roger Sayle (Glaxo).

   o  Added Rasmol-2.6, a version of rasmol which reads CEX streams.
      Contributed by Roger Sayle (Glaxo).

   o  Added dgeom, a version of DGEOM2 which reads and writes CEX streams.
      Ported by David Spellmeyer (Chiron), not yet contributed.
      (To be contributed by Jeff Blaney (Chiron), Gordon Crippen (U. Michigan),
      Andrew Dearing (Shell), Scott Dixon (SKB), David Spellmeyer (Chiron).

   o  Added compare, a new program which clusters conformations.
      Ported by David Spellmeyer (Chiron), not yet contributed.
      To be contributed by Jeff Blaney (Chiron).

   o  Changed internal procedure for object-child instantiation to allow
      constant-time object creation.  Broad objects like protein surfaces
      (e.g., 15000 apexes, 30000 faces as children of single surface) can
      now be read in quickly.  Contributed by Dave Weininger (Daylight)
      and Conrad Huang (UCSF).

   o  Target distribution extended to:
      [o] SunOS-4.1
      [o] SunOS-5.4
      [o] Irix-4.1
      [x] Irix-5.2

SPECIFIC CHANGES FOLLOW
============================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex032->cex033  Dave Weininger

Changed the way cex streams are read in:

   o  Root objects are still read in by polymorphic function cx_cexin().

   o  When a root object is encountered as part of an object (as an
      identifier or dataitem) the polymorphic cx_cexin() function is used
      to interpret that part of the object.  For instance, this object is
      parsed by (m)olecule_cexin, (c)amera_cexin, and (s)urface_cexin:

	 $MOL<CC>/REM<one>CAMERA<...>$SURF<...&...>CURVE<...>/REM<two>|
	 mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmcccccccccccsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssm

   o  The (semi-)public function cx_tag2roottype() was added to cx_cex_io.c
      and cx_cex_io.h.  It returns the root type corresponding to a given
      tag or CX_OB_INVALID if not valid or not a root type.

   o  Code was added to cx_molecule.c, cx_surface.c, and cu_camera.c to
      implement the above changes.

   o  Definitions for CX_TUPLESHAPE() and CX_SHAPE_* added to cx_types.h:
         #define CX_SHAPE_VERTEX 'V'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex032->cex033  Dave Weininger

Changed a number of things about surfaces:

   o  Surfaces contain vertices and faces as normally invisible components
      Vertex positions are no longer visible properties.
      Faces are no longer visible children.

   o  SURF surface objects are represented lexically in the SURFEX language.

   o  Surfaces are sent as sub-id's if has_visible_children()

   o  Changed datatype defs (cx_surface_define_datatypes(), datatypes.dts)

   o  Changed property name macros in cx_surface.h to CX_PROP_ prefix, e.g.
      old way:   #define CX_PROP_TAG_CURVE  "curvature"
      new way:   #define CX_PROP_CURVE  "curvature"

   o  Replaced interactive test program trysurface with simpler testsurface.
      old way:   $ trysurf 63
      new way:   $ testsurf | printcex -63

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex032->cex033  Dave Weininger

Changed a number of things about camera support:

   o  Included cu_camera.h in cu.h

   o  Changed a camera property definitions to have primitive values
      in cu_camera_define_datatypes() and datatypes.dts

   o  Replaced interactive test program trycamera with simpler cameraone.
      old way:   $ trycamera 63
      new way    $ cameraone | printcex -63

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex032->cex033  Dave Weininger

Changed $CX_ROOT/data/dts.cex to $CX_ROOT/data/datatypes.cex:
   o added comments
   o removed unused/obsolete/unapproved entries: MP, CONF, ORI
   o added surface and camera datatypes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex031->cex032  Dave Weininger
Changed makefile.mdep.sun5 RANLIB definition to true (disabled ranlib)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex031->cex032 ???

There were some last-minute changes by Roger Sayle?  Dave Spellmeyer?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex031->cex031
src/cobweb/cx_basics.c
Corrected the code to functions returning NULL as a cx_Integer!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex031->cex031 -- Roger Sayle
src/wrappers/f77/cx_f_wrappers.c
Solved memory deallocation problem in _cx_f_sprop which was "free"ing
memory that it shouldn't be in the stack frame or common blocks!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex031->cex031 -- Roger Sayle
src/cobweb/cx_utils.c
src/cobweb/cx_cex_io.c
Changed references of "strdup" to "cx_strdup" [For MacOS]


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex030->cex031 -- Conrad Huang

Nesting level set too low when parsing SMILES.

src/molecule/cx_molecule.c:140
   Changed:
      #define MX_NESTING         40
   to
      #define MX_NESTING         4096

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex030->cex031 -- Conrad Huang

Compile error on OSF1 because preprocessor line begins with whitespace
instead of #

src/cobweb/cx_cex_io.c:864
   Changed line to:
       #ifdef OLDWAY
   to:
      #ifdef OLDWAY

src/cobweb/cx_cex_io.c:869
   Changed line to:
       #endif
   to:
      #endif
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex030->cex031  -- Dave Weininger, Conrad Huang

   Changed internal procedure for object-child instantiation to allow
   faster object creation.  All changes are in cobweb/cx_basics.c, most are
   in cx_e_set_parent().  Effects: object size increased by 4 bytes, object
   creation (initial parenting) is now constant-time rather than linear in
   the number of siblings.  (Object reparenting and deletion still linear.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex030->cex031 -- Conrad Huang

Tested on OSF1

src/etc/makefile.mdep.osf1
   New file containing OS dependencies for OSF1

src/etc/cx_install:63
   Added lines:
       OSF1)
         systype="osf1"
         ;;

src/etc/makefile.mdep.*:
   Added definition for RANLIB

src/cobweb/Makefile:
src/molecule/Makefile:
cu/setpart/Makefile:
   Replaced "make" constructs of (LIBRARY)(OBJECT) and use ar/RANLIB explicitly

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex029->cex030 -- Jack Delany (via dw):


Link error on Irix because a static function (normh(), in cx_molecule.c)
wasn't declared before use.  Strange, since default prototype should have
been ok.

src/molecule/cx_molecule.c:187
Add line:
static int normh(cx_Object);

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex029->cex030 -- Jack Delany (via dw):

src/applics/mol/amw.c:88
   Change:
      return sprintf(buf, "%.*f", p, amw);
   to:
      sprintf(buf, "%.*f", p, amw);
      return (buf);

Now, CEX compiles on IRIX4 also.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex029->cex030 -- Jack Delany (via dw):

CX_ROOT:sh = pwd

is not a generally supported make directive (only SUN).  Remove d
it from two different makefiles.  One needs to set the environment 
variable CX_ROOT onesself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cex029->cex030 -- Jack Delany (via dw):

In the makefile.mdep.sgi5, there are a couple of places where a rule-line 
doesn't start with <tab>, so make complains.  Pretty minor.  Fixed.
