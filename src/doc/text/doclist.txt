                                 Version 0.33



The following documents are supplied with this distribution:

   1. CEX Documentation List

      This is the document you are currently reading.  It mainly
      provides a place to keep track of all the documentation for
      a given release.

      outlining the distribution contents, avaliable documentation,
      and installation procedures.

   3. CEX User's Guide

      The user guide is intended to contain an introduction to the CEX
      utilities oriented to the end-user, provide an overview of the
      CEX applications supplied in this release and to illustrate the
      intended usage of these applications.  In this release, the user
      guide is just a stub, which will be filled out after the initial
      set of applications settles down.

   4. CEX Programmer's Guide

      The programmer's guide is intended to provide information and
      guidance needed to port an existing application to use CEX I/O
      or to write a native CEX filter.  The current incarnation is
      kind of heavy on philosophy and a bit light on complex examples.
      By design, it contains no reference information.

   5. CEX Developer's Guide

      The developer's guide contains information about the CX development
      system itself and instructions for programmers who are interested
      in doing low-level things like inventing their own object classes.
      Some of the information contained here probably belongs in the
      programmer's guide.

   6. man(1cx) pages

      Section 1cx manual pages provide reference for CEX application
      programs.  The manual pages provided for CEX applications in this
      release are complete, but the set of applications itself is far
      from complete.

      source:  $CX_ROOT/src/doc/man/mansrc/mansrc1/*.mansrc
      product: $CX_ROOT/doc/man/man1cx/*.1cx        (man pages)
               $CX_ROOT/doc/man/postman/man1cx.ps   (postscript version)
      status:  done


   7. man(3cx) pages

      Section 3cx manual pages provide reference for CX library functions
      in libcx.a and an example function in libcu.a.  These man pages
      form the bulk of the documentation needed to create CEX-compatible
      programs.  Only high-level CX-interface functions used at the
      application-level are described in detail (one per page).
      Low-level functions are all described on the lowelevel(3cx) page.

      source:  $CX_ROOT/src/doc/man/mansrc/mansrc3/*.mansrc
      product: $CX_ROOT/doc/man/man3cx/*.3cx        (man pages)

      Section 5cx manual pages provide reference for CX primitive and
      object types.
